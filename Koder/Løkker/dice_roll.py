#Suppose we have two dice. üé≤ üé≤

#Create a game where one guesses the total value after rolling a pair of dice once.

#Each die has the integer values 1 to 6. Since there's two dice, the range of possible values is between 2 and 12 (inclusive).

#Use the random module to ‚Äúroll‚Äù the dice and store the random values of each die variable in a new total variable.

#Until the correct value is guessed, use a while loop to keep prompting the user for a number.

#Use while loops along with methods from the random module to solve this challenge.
