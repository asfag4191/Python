#A number is "squared" when it is either multiplied by itself or taken to the second power (e.g., 4Â² = 4 x 4 = 16).

#First, ask the user for an integer with int(input()) and store it in a number variable. Then, define a total variable with an initial value of 0.

#Note: You can pass a string prompt to int(input()).

#Next, use a for loop and range() function to calculate the total of the squares of all integers from 1 to that number.

#Last, print the output as an integer value.

number = int(input("Write an integer: "))
total = 0

for i in range(1, number + 1):  # Start from 1, include the number itself
    total += i ** 2  # Add the square of i to total

print(total)
